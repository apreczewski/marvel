The data can be used and shared on all devices, easily and without additional software. All this is done in short production time, with a lot of flexibility for you as a user and maximum scalability.

  "If the Buyer must substantiate": "If the Buyer must substantiate the non-observance of the deadline, the Supplier shall be entitled to assert compensation for loss incurred by default for each full week by up to 0.5 % of the purchase price. The right to prove a higher damage, in particular higher storage costs, is reserved. The Supplier, however, is entitled to withdraw from the contract after a reasonable deadline or to otherwise dispose of the article of sale. Further claims of the Supplier because of default in acceptance remain unaffected.",
  "If the Buyer`s lack of creditworthiness": "If the Buyer`s lack of creditworthiness or another cause for a temporary or final jeopardy for the performance of duty of payment transpires after the conclusion of contract, the Supplier may suspend deliveries or other contractual performances, if simultaneously giving notice to the Buyer, and requiring payment in advance, bank guarantee or security deposit for providing an otherwise given adequate guarantee for further fulfillment of the contract.",
  "If the fix fails and the Buyer": "If the fix fails and the Buyer validly rescinds the contract, the Supplier takes back the article of sale in return for the purchase price, deducting a compensation for actual possible use.",
  "If the products delivered by the Supplier": "If the products delivered by the Supplier prove to be defective because they are not of the agreed condition, or because they are not usable for the agreed or intended purpose and prove to be useless or substantially limited in their usefulness within 12 months after setup because of circumstances arisen before the passing of the risk, the Supplier shall either remedy the parts concerned, or deliver new parts at his own discretion. Asserting a warranty claim requires that the Buyer notify the Supplier of the defect immediately after receipt of the shipment in writing according to § 377 Code of German Commercial Law (HGB).",

  "In production employees can be familiarized": "​​In production, employees can be familiarized with new work steps in a virtual environment. For example, the maintenance of a system or the operation of a new machine can be practiced in a virtual environment. In this way, running processes do not have to be interrupted. Especially with expensive machines and systems, it is helpful if employees first gain confidence before they put the knowledge they have acquired into practice. With plants in operation, it is often not possible or difficult to train during the running process. Virtual training thus helps to avoid cost-intensive damage or production downtimes. In the end, investments in virtual training lead to an increased overall plant effectiveness.",
  "In the event of a breach": "In the event of a breach of a so-called “cardinal obligation”, which is a breach of contractual duties that are essential to the execution of the contract and on which the Buyer may reasonably rely, and in the event of defects which have either been fraudulently concealed or constitute a breach of a guarantee that such defect will not occur, the Supplier`s liability is limited to such damages insurable, foreseeable and typical for the contract. Supplier will assign any insurance claims to the Buyer regarding product liability or third-party liability, who will, in return, release the Supplier from any liability in the amount of such insurance cover. Further claims of the Buyer for damages or reimbursement of expenses are excluded, in particular claims for consequential damages such as loss of production, loss of use, loss of profit.",
